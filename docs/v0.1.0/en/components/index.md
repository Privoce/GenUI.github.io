## Introduction

`GenUI Builtin Components` is a `Makepad` component library that can be directly integrated into the `Makepad` project. As the core component library of `GenUI`, it can serve as the basic building block of the `GenUI` project to speed up the development process of front-end developers.

However, this is more than just a component library. It contains many built-in macros and system APIs that simplify the development workflow and extend the current functionality of `Makepad`. It only represents a part of many basic modules in `GenUI`, and its functions are similar to `HTML` elements, but it is designed with a more modern approach.

> **Currently `GenUI` only integrates a small part of the components in `GenUI Builtin Components`, and we will gradually add more powerful components as the version is updated.**
