# Quick Start

This is a quick start example, through which you can quickly understand the development process of GenUI.

## Environment Description

|Name|Version|
|--|--|
|Mac|-|
|Ract|0.1.0|

> [!TIP]
>
> For more detailed Ract commands, please refer to: [Ract](/doc/tutorial/ract)

## Install and configure Ract

`Ract` is the first step in your journey to GenUI, please choose the latest version to download

> Releases: https://github.com/Privoce/ract/releases

### Configuration

> [!WARNING]
>
> Your computer may prompt security issues, please select Allow
>
> The current Windows system packaging problem has not been resolved

You can configure ract as a global command in the following ways:

<Tabs>
    <Tab label="Macos | Linux">
        ```shell
        # copy download ract to /usr/local/bin
        sudo cp /path/to/download/ract /usr/local/bin/ract/ract

        # add permission
        sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/ract
        sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/ract/ract

        # confirm permission
        sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/bin/ract

        # echo to .zshrc
        echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin/ract:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

        source ~/.zshrc
        # get version
        ract --version
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Windows">
        ```
        You just need to set Ract into your environment variables
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Usage

- Input｜Select End. Use `Enter` to complete the current operation

- When a tab appears, use `Space` to add or switch options

- You need to use the `↑` `↓` keys to switch tabs
- You need to use the `←` `→` keys to adjust the cursor position when inputting
- You need to enter `Yes`/`y` or `No`/`n` to indicate yes or no when a question appears
- Please use `ctrl + c` when an error occurs or you need to undo reset or stop

## Create a project with Ract

Run the `ract create` command, Ract will automatically help you detect the environment. When all tool chains are complete, Ract will help you build a project

Ract will prompt you that the relevant tool chain is missing. If your tool chain is incomplete, you can directly use the `ract install` command to install it in response

> [!TIP]
>
> If you are a novice, you may need to install:
> - rustc, git, makepad
> - git
> - makepad
> - gen_components
> - wasm_build
> - default
>
> All you have to do is select the installation items

### An example of an interactive dialog for install

```shell
🥳 Welcome to use ract Install!

🔸 Select the tools to install:
  - rustc
  - cargo
  - git
  - makepad tools (default or custom options)
? What tools you want to (re)install?
> [ ] rustc|cargo
  [ ] git
  [x] makepad
? What you need to (re)install?  
  [x] gen_components
  [ ] android_build
  [ ] ios_build
> [x] wasm_build
  [ ] makepad_studio
  [x] default
```
### An example of an interactive dialog for create

```shell
❤️ WELOCME TO GENUI, ract is a build tool for you!
🔸 Current states:
        🔻 Basic Tools

🛠️ ract is creating a new GenUI workspace `quickstart` in: /Users/shengyifei/projects/gen_ui/made_with_GenUI
🚀 Create a new workspace project successfully!
🚀 Create a new cargo project successfully!
🎉 Your project has been created successfully!
```

## Start the project

In GenUI, you need to use `ract run` to start the project

> [!TIP]
>
> You don't need to `cd` to the source project code directory, just `cd` to the GenUI project root directory
>
> The GenUI project is a typical Rust Workspace project, and the project root directory is the Workspace directory
>
> For example, you used `ract create` to build a workspace named `quickstart` at `/Users/John/projects/gen_ui_project`.
> You only need to `cd` to `/Users/John/projects/gen_ui_project/quickstart`. Then run `ract run` directly

### Startup results

After startup, you will get the following output in the terminal:

```shell
🥳 Welcome to use ract project runner!

🔸 Now you can run makepad and gen_ui (Comming Soon) project
❗️ Please make sure your project root has a `.ract` file to point the project kind
🔸 If you do not know `.ract` file, please run `ract book` to search (Comming Soon)

GenUI-Compiler :: [2025-01-23 12:00:55] :: INFO >>> 🔧 Log Service is starting... Log entries will be available after the `app event::Change` occurs!
    Creating binary (application) `src_gen_0` package
note: see more `Cargo.toml` keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html
GenUI-Compiler :: [2025-01-23 12:00:55] :: INFO >>> 🔧 Watcher Service started successfully! Ract is watching: `/Users/John/projects/gen_ui_project/quickstart/start`
```

At this time, Ract is helping you monitor and compile your GenUI project in real time

### Start the UI

After starting, you will get a compiled package named `src_gen_0` in the workspace. 
You need to add a terminal and `cd` to this directory and use `cargo run` to start the project

```shell
cd src_gen_0

cargo run
```

You will end up with a view:

![](/quickstart/makepad_genui.png)

## Add new components to page 

Next, we add a text component and a multiple-select box component to the `home` page

Open the `home.gen` file in the `views` directory in the `start` directory

![](/quickstart/home.png)

Add the following code to `<template>`:

```html title="home.gen"
<label text="'Hello GenUI!!!'" font_size="16.0"></label>
<checkbox text="'I am a checkbox'"></checkbox>
```

The complete `<template>` code is as follows:

```html title="home.gen"
<template>
    <component name="Home" class="home_view">
        <Hello id="header"></Hello>
        <button id="my_btn" theme="Error" @clicked="click_btn()">
            <label as_prop="slot" text="'Click Me!'" font_size="12.0"></label>
        </button>
        <label text="'Hello GenUI!!!'" font_size="16.0"></label>
        <checkbox text="'I am a checkbox'"></checkbox>
    </component>
</template>
```

After Ract performs incremental compilation, you will get the following output:

```shell
GenUI-Compiler :: [2025-01-23 12:10:00] :: INFO >>> File `/Users/John/projects/gen_ui_project/quickstart/start/views/home.gen` compiled successfully.
```

And the view will automatically update:

![](/quickstart/makepad_genui2.png)
