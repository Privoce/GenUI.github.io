# Component Type

The component types here only refer to builtin components and custom components

## Builtin Components

Built-in components refer to the underlying components that can be used directly during development without the need to develop them yourself. These underlying components are provided by [GenUI Builtin Components](/components/index).

All builtin component properties and callbacks are immutable and have built-in types

## Custom Components

Custom components refer to components that are secondary developed based on existing components during development.

To put it simply, any component wrapped with `<component name="SpecialName"></component>` is a custom component.

1. The `name` of a custom component indicates the component name when the component is referenced externally
2. Custom components can also have an `id` attribute. `id` and `name` are independent of each other. For custom components, `id` is only valid internally, and `name` is valid externally. That is: [Inside-outside principle](/doc/tutorial/template/basic#internal-and-external-principles)
3. The `<component>` tag has no meaning, it only represents the declaration of the custom component
4. Custom components inherit the `view` component by default, so the properties of the `view` component can also be used by custom components
5. Custom components do not inherit the callbacks of the `view` component, only the properties
6. The `<component>` tag can only be used at the root
