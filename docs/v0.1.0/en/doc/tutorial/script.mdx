# Scripts

The script part of `GenUI` uses the Rust language and is wrapped in the `<script>` tag in the `.gen` file.

## Define component properties

For custom components, we need to use the `#[prop]` macro to declare the component's properties, but not all types are allowed. The types that can be used in the properties need to implement the `Default` trait.

```rust
<script>
#[prop]
pub struct MyView{
    name: String
}
</script>
```

## Define component events

Custom components do not have any events. Events need to be declared using the `#[event]` macro, and `#[derive(Debug, Clone)]` needs to be added.

```rust
#[event]
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub enum MyViewEvent{
    Clicked,
    Changed(String),
}
```

In the example above, we defined two event callbacks:

1. `Clicked`
2. `Changed`

Among them, `Clicked` does not have any callback parameters, and the callback parameter of `Changed` is of `String` type.

## Data Binding

We have learned how to define component properties in the previous section, and data binding of component templates is also based on property definitions

In this example, we define the value of the `text` property of `label` in `MyView`. For the bound value, `GenUI` will automatically generate the corresponding `get` and `set` methods.

```rust
<template>
    <component name="MyView">
        <label id="my_label" :text="txt"></label>
        <button id="my_btn" @clicked="change_txt()"></button>
    </component>
</template>

<script>
#[prop]
pub struct MyView{
    txt: String
}

let mut prop = default_prop!{
    MyView{
        txt: "Hello".to_string()
    }
};
</script>
```

In this code, the `get_txt` and `set_txt` methods are automatically generated.

## Methods and callbacks

For methods and callbacks, use `fn` or `closure` to declare them. In the following example, we define the `change_txt` method as the callback method for button clicks.

```rust
<template>
    <component name="MyView">
        <label id="my_label" :text="txt"></label>
        <button id="my_btn" @clicked="change_txt()"></button>
    </component>
</template>

<script>
#[prop]
pub struct MyView{
    txt: String
}

let mut prop = default_prop!{
    MyView{
        txt: "Hello".to_string()
    }
};

fn change_txt(){
    prop.set_txt("World".to_string());
}
</script>
```

The above method can also be rewritten using `closure`

```rust
let mut change_txt = ||{
    prop.set_txt("World".to_string());
};
```
