# Overview

The tutorial module is the starting point for your GenUI journey. From environment configuration to tool download, 
from basic syntax to quick start, we will guide you step by step through a series of easy-to-understand examples to gain a deeper understanding of the core functions of GenUI. 
Through these tutorials, you can not only master the basic operations, but also further consolidate your knowledge through practical projects.

## Learning Order Recommendation

<Steps>
    ### QuickStart

    > GenUI Quick Start Project

    ### [Ract Tool](https://github.com/Privoce/ract)

    > Ract is a conversational CLI tool written in Rust that aims to simplify the development process by providing an all-in-one solution.

    ### Project structure description

    > Explain the structure of the GenUI project and the purpose of each file

    ### `<template>`

    > In the template structure syntax part, GenUI `template` adopts the writing method similar to `HTML` and expands and constrains it on this basis

    ### `<style>`

    > In the template style syntax part, GenUI `style` is also similar to native `CSS` and has been enhanced. Its writing method is closer to `SCSS`


    > In addition, `style` can also be called `prop`, because it corresponds to the properties of the components in `template`

    ### `script` (API)

    > The "script" part of GenUI uses the rust language. Although it is called a script, it is different from typical js, py, and lua
