## Learning Order Recommendation

<Steps>
    ### QuickStart

    > GenUI Quick Start Project

    ### Project Structure

    > Explain the structure of the GenUI project and the purpose of each file

    ### `<template>`

    > In the template structure syntax part, GenUI `template` adopts the writing method of `HTML` and expands and constrains it on this basis

    ### `<style>`

    > In the template style syntax part, GenUI `style` is also similar to native `CSS` and has been enhanced. Its writing method is closer to `SCSS`
    >
    > In addition, `style` can also be called `prop`, because it corresponds to the properties of the components in `template`

    ### `script` (API)

    > The "script" part of GenUI uses the rust language. Although it is called a script, it is different from typical js, py, and lua.
