# Env

These are two files related to the configuration of the `Ract` environment. Generally speaking, you don't need to pay attention to them unless you need a development environment that is not directly hosted by Ract

> [!TIP]
>
> You can find them manually for configuration or use the `config` command provided by `Ract` for configuration
>
> Compared with manual, we recommend that you use the `ract config` command
>
> If you don't know how to use `Ract`, please refer to: [Ract Instructions](zh/tools/ract/introduction#Instructions)

## Ract installation directory structure description

Take `Ract` installed using `cargo` as an example:

```
~/.cargo/bin
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ ract
â”œâ”€â”€ chain/
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ env.toml
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ gen_components/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ makepad/
â””â”€â”€ .env
```

## `.env`

`.env` is the file that Ract points to for `env.toml`

### Configuration instructions

```toml title=".env"
/path/to/env.toml
```

### Set Config

<Tabs>
    <Tab label="ract config">
        Use the `config` command and select the first `env` option, then select the `set` option
        ```shell
        ract config
        ```
        The followings are options:
        ```shell
        ðŸ¥³ Welcome to use ract config!

        ðŸ”¸ env: Set the `path` for the chain env.toml file
        ðŸ”¸ chain_env_toml: Set the rust dependency for GenUI toolchain

        ? Which env file do you want to config?
        > env
        chain_env_toml
        # ---
        ? Get or Set Config?
        get
        > set
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Manual Configuration">
        You need to find the installation address of ract, for example, if you use `cargo` to install it, the address is: `~/.cargo/bin/.env`
        ```shell
        vim ~/.cargo/bin/.env
        ```
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

## `env.toml`(chain_env_toml)

`env.toml` is the environment configuration file of `Ract`. From the content in this file, `Ract` can find the environment dependencies when the user is developing.

### Configuration instructions

Only `[dependencies]` in the `env.toml` file points to the dependency location

```toml title="env.toml"
version = "0.1.6"
is_latest = true
auto_update = true
check = { auto = true, last_time = 1741547846, frequency = 172800 }

[dependencies]
makepad-widgets = "~/.cargo/bin/chain/makepad"
gen_components = "~/.cargo/bin/chain/gen_components"
```

### Set Config

The modification method of `env.toml` is the same as `.env`. You only need to select `chain_env_toml` when `Ract` asks you.
