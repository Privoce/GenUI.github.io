# Installation

In the `GenUI` project, there is no need to manually install `GenUI Builtin Components`. These configurations will be automatically built when creating a project using `Ract`.

## Configuration Instructions

You will see the following configuration in the `gen_ui.toml` file automatically built by `Ract`:

```toml title="gen_ui.toml"
[makepad.dependencies]
gen_components = { path = "path/to/gen_components" }
```

> [!TIP]
>
> If you do not see this configuration, please use the `get` command of `ract config` to get the directory of `gen_components` and add it,
> and post this issue to `GenUI` to `issue` or our Discord channel, I will reply to you as soon as possible
