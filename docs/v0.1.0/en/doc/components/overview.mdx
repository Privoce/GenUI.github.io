## Introduction

`GenUI Builtin Components` is a `Makepad` component library that can be directly integrated into `Makepad` projects. As the core component library of `GenUI`, it can be used as a basic building block for `GenUI` projects to speed up the development process of front-end developers.

However, this is more than just a component library. It contains many built-in macros and system APIs that simplify the development workflow and extend the current functionality of `Makepad`. It only represents a part of many basic modules in `GenUI`, and its functions are similar to `HTML` elements, but designed with a more modern approach.
