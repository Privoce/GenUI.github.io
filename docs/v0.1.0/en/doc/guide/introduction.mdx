## SFP

GenUI's SFP function refers to its pluggable design, which can adjust and use different underlying technologies or frameworks according to the needs of developers. We currently use Makepad as the underlying layer. This design allows GenUI to extend and customize its functions through plug-ins designed specifically for these underlying frameworks, so as to better adapt to various development scenarios.

1. Provide powerful capabilities through plugins
2. Not limited by inherent underlying systems
3. Also a challenge

## Advantages

- Multi-framework compatibility
- Flexible
- Scalable
- Community support
- Respect for users

## Target audience

- Front-end developers and full-stack developers
- Developers of innovative and experimental projects
- Open source community
- Independent developers
- Small and medium-sized project development (now)
