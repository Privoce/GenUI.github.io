# Ract for GenUI

> [!TIP]
> 
> You don't need to `cd` to the source project code directory, just `cd` to the GenUI project root directory
>
> The GenUI project is a typical Rust Workspace project, and the project root directory is the Workspace directory
>
> For example, you used `ract create` to build a workspace named `quickstart` at `/Users/John/projects/gen_ui_project`.
> You only need to `cd` to `/Users/John/projects/gen_ui_project/quickstart`. Then run `ract run` directly

## `create` - Create a GenUI project

Ract will build the **GenUI** project template according to the configuration entered by the user
