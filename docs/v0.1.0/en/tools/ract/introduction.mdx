## How to use Documentation 

If you just want to get started quickly and use it, you can only look at [Basic Use](/tools/ract/common_commands) and the corresponding framework use

When you only use Ract in the `GenUI` project, you only need to learn:
- [Basic Use](/tools/ract/common_commands)
- [Ract for GenUI](/tools/ract/gen_ui)

## Instructions

- Input｜Select End needs to use `Enter` to complete the current operation
- When a tab appears, use `Space` to add or switch options
- You need to use the `↑` `↓` keys to switch tabs
- You need to use the `←` `→` keys to adjust the cursor position when inputting
- You need to enter `Yes`/`y` or `No`/`n` to indicate yes or no when a query item appears
- When an error occurs or you need to undo reset or stop, please use `ctrl + c`
