# Basic usage

> [!NOTE]
>
> Whether it is Makepad or GenUI, the usage of `init`, `check`, `install`, `config`, `run`, `wasm` commands are the same
>
> You only need to pay attention to: `create`, `studio`, `pkg`
>
> And `init`, `check`, `config` are all automatic

## `init` - Initialize Ract

Initialize or reset the CLI. Ract will generate:

1. `.env`

2. `chain/`
- `chain/env.toml`

```bash
ract init
```

Output:
```plaintext
🚀 Start to init ract...
✅ Chain init successfully!
🎉 Init ract successfully!
```

## `check` - Check the toolchain

Check if the required tools and dependencies are installed. Options include:
- **Basic**: `[cargo, rustc, git]`
- **Underlayer**: `[makepad (gen_ui, makepad)]`
- **All**: Combines basic tools and low-level tools.

```bash
ract check
```

Interactive dialog example:
```plaintext
🥳 Welcome to use ract checker!
? Which you need to check?
> Basic
Underlayer
All
```

## `install` - Install toolchain

Install tools and dependencies required for development. Available options:
- **Rust tools**: `rustc`, `cargo`
- **Version control**: `git`
- **Makepad-specific tools**: Including components such as `gen_components`, `wasm_build`.

```bash
ract install
```

Interactive dialog example:
```plaintext
🥳 Welcome to use ract Install!

🔸 Select the tools to install:
- rustc
- cargo
- git
- makepad tools (default or custom options)
? What tools you want to (re)install?
> [ ] rustc|cargo
[ ] git
[x] makepad
```

## `config` - Configure the CLI

Set or update environment variables and CLI configuration.

> [!TIP]
>
> In most cases, you don't need to configure anything unless you already have Ract-related dependencies and need to point to them

```bash
ract config
```

Interactive dialog example:
```plaintext
🥳 Welcome to use ract config!

🔸 env: Set the `path` for the chain env.toml file
🔸 chain_env_toml: Set the rust dependency for GenUI toolchain

> Which env file do you want to config? chain_env_toml
> Get or Set Config? set
> Which one do you want to config? makepad-widgets
> Path: /Users/shengyifei/projects/makepad/makepad
🎉 Config finish!
```
