# Installation and Configuration

Currently `Ract` has been released to [crate.io](https://crates.io/) and [Github](https://github.com/), you can choose either installation method

## crate.io

We have released it to `crate.io`, so you can also install it directly using cargo

> [!NOTE]
>
> Although you may find that the current `Ract` version on `crate.io` is `v0.1.2`, it is actually `v0.1.1` released on Github

```shell
cargo install ract
```

That's pretty simple, right? If you installed the rust toolchain correctly, this is what it will look like. You can just use it.

```shell
ract --version
```

## Github Releases

Please select the latest version in [Ract Releases](https://github.com/Privoce/ract/releases) and install it according to your operating system

>
> Linux corresponds to `Ubuntu`

You can configure ract as a global command in the following ways:

        ```shell
        # copy download ract to /usr/local/bin
        sudo cp /path/to/download/ract /usr/local/bin/ract/ract

        # add permission
        sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/ract
        sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/ract/ract

        # confirm permission
        sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/bin/ract

        # echo to .zshrc
        echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin/ract:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

        # fresh zshrc
        source ~/.zshrc

        # get version
        ract --version
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab label="Windows">
        ### Download and rename

        After you finish downloading, please place `ract_windows_gnu.exe` in a directory and rename it to `ract.exe`

        ### Set Ract to environment variables
        Enter the system environment variables, select `Path` and add a new directory address where `ract.exe` is located

        For example: the address of ract is `E://ract/ract.exe`, then the new environment variable address is `E://ract` or `E:\ract`
