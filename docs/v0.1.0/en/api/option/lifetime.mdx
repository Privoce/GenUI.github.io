## `#[before_mount]`

Called immediately after the component instance is initialized. Use the `#[before_mount]` annotation on a method or closure.

### Usage

```rust
impl MyView{
    #[before_mount]
    fn before_mount(){
        println!("before mount!");
    }
}
```

## `#[mounted]`

Options called after instance initialization is complete

### Usage

```rust
impl MyView{
    #[mounted]
    fn mounted(){
        println!("mounted!");
    }
}
```

## `#[before_update]`

Called after component properties are updated but before re-rendering the component

### Usage

## `#[updated]`

Called after the component properties have been updated and the component has been re-rendered.

### Usage

```rust
impl Hello{
    #[updated]
    fn do_updated(&mut self){
        println!("do updated => hello.gen!");
        let new_val = self.get_count() + 1;
        self.set_count(new_val);
    }   
}
```
