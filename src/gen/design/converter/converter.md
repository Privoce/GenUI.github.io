# Converter

The purpose of my framework is to allow users to write the necessary code without learning other GUI libraries. 

For example, you don't need to learn Makepad to use this framework directly. Use the most basic Rust STD library to convert this framework into Makepad's DSL and other code for handling events and property binding.

I think it is very user-friendly for users.

Of course, I believe that my framework is not a replacement for Makepad, but rather simplifies the difficulty of writing Makepad code. 

For most people, they may not need very fancy special effects, but rather quickly start to implement a product.

For those who pursue higher goals, Makepad can be directly used in DSL
